# Tech Stack

## Overview

The `suno-forge` project is built upon a modern and robust technology stack designed for efficiency, scalability, and an excellent developer experience.

## Core Technologies

-   **Programming Language:** TypeScript
    -   **Rationale:** Provides static typing for improved code quality, maintainability, and developer productivity, especially important for a growing codebase.
-   **Frameworks:**
    -   **Next.js:** A React framework for building full-stack web applications.
        -   **Rationale:** Enables server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), API routes, and a highly optimized development experience, crucial for a performance-oriented web application.
    -   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
        -   **Rationale:** Its component-based architecture promotes reusability and maintainability, ideal for constructing the interactive prompt engineering toolkit.
-   **Styling:**
    -   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework.
        -   **Rationale:** Facilitates rapid UI development with highly customizable, low-level utility classes, ensuring a consistent and flexible design system.
    -   **Radix UI:** A collection of unstyled, accessible UI components.
        -   **Rationale:** Provides high-quality, accessible building blocks that integrate seamlessly with Tailwind CSS, offering a solid foundation for complex UI elements like dropdowns and labels.

## Key Libraries and Services

-   **OpenAI:**
    -   **Rationale:** Utilized for potential AI-driven enhancements, particularly in prompt generation and mutation, leveraging advanced language models.
-   **Supabase:**
    -   **Rationale:** Integrated for backend services, including authentication and database capabilities, providing a robust and scalable solution for user management and data storage.

## Package Management

-   **npm:** Node Package Manager.
    -   **Rationale:** Standard package manager for JavaScript projects, used for dependency management and running development scripts.
