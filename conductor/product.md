# Initial Concept

This project, `suno-forge`, is a Next.js application designed as a powerful prompt engineering toolkit for the Suno music generation AI. Its core purpose is to provide a user interface and a backend API to systematically construct, mutate, and generate prompts for creating music. The application offers features for single prompt generation, batch generation, and a "vision" feature to generate prompts from image descriptions.
