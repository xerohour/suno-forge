# Product Guidelines

## Prose Style

The prose style of `suno-forge` will be a unique blend of creative, evocative language and technical precision. This dual-tone approach is designed to cater to both the artistic and engineering aspects of prompt creation for music generation.

### Creative and Evocative Language

- **Inspiring Tone:** The language used throughout the application and its documentation should be inspiring and encouraging. It should spark creativity and make the user feel like they are embarking on a musical journey.
- **Musical Metaphors:** Whenever appropriate, use metaphors related to music, composition, and artistry. This will create a more immersive and engaging experience. For example, instead of "parameters," we might use terms like "instrumentation" or "tonality" where it makes sense and doesn't obscure meaning.
- **Focus on Possibility:** The language should emphasize the creative possibilities that `suno-forge` unlocks. It should encourage experimentation and exploration.

### Technical and Precise Language

- **Accuracy and Detail:** While the tone is creative, the technical aspects of prompt engineering must be communicated with utmost accuracy and detail. All parameters, settings, and functionalities should be clearly and unambiguously explained.
- **Formal Language for Technical Sections:** In sections of the documentation or UI that deal with the technical underpinnings of the tool, a more formal and precise language should be used. This ensures that experienced prompt engineers can find the information they need quickly and efficiently.
- **Clarity and Unambiguity:** There should be no room for misinterpretation when it comes to the technical details. The language must be clear, concise, and to the point.

## Guiding Principle

Our guiding principle is to treat `suno-forge` as both a musical instrument and a precision tool. The language we use should reflect this duality, empowering our users to be both artists and engineers in the realm of AI music generation.
