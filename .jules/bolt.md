## 2025-02-18 - Bun Test Requirement
**Learning:** `npm test` fails in this environment due to network restrictions and configuration issues with `ts-jest`. `bun test` works out of the box and is significantly faster.
**Action:** Always use `bun test` for running tests in this repository.

## 2025-02-18 - Static String Pre-computation
**Learning:** `GENRE_DATA` contained static arrays that were joined into strings on every `buildStyle` call. Pre-computing these strings saves CPU cycles on a hot path.
**Action:** Look for other static data structures that are transformed at runtime and pre-compute them if possible.

## 2025-02-18 - Exception Handling Overhead
**Learning:** Using `try-catch` for expected control flow (e.g., handling unknown genres) introduces unnecessary overhead. Returning `undefined` and checking for it is significantly faster.
**Action:** Avoid exceptions for non-exceptional cases; use `undefined` or `Result` types for expected failures.

## 2025-02-18 - Array Chaining vs Loops
**Learning:** Chaining `.filter().map()` creates intermediate arrays and iterates multiple times. For hot paths, a single `for` loop is more memory efficient and faster.
**Action:** Prefer single loops over array method chains in performance-critical code sections.

## 2025-02-18 - RegExp Callbacks vs Multiple Passes
**Learning:** Performing multiple `String.prototype.replace()` passes with a placeholder system for cyclical replacements (O(N*M)) is slow. Using a single pre-compiled regular expression with a callback mapping function (O(N)) provides an immediate ~300% performance boost and is more memory efficient.
**Action:** Always prefer a single pre-compiled regex with a callback over iterative placeholder replacements for multiple simultaneous string substitutions.

## 2025-02-18 - Object Allocation in Hot Paths
**Learning:** Re-allocating static configuration objects (like `MUTATION_HANDLERS` in `mutatePrompt`) inside functions called frequently wastes CPU cycles and stresses the garbage collector.
**Action:** Extract static configuration objects and maps to module-level constants.
## 2025-02-18 - RegExp Match Resolution Behavior
**Learning:** Replacing an object property iteration (`for...in`) with a dynamic regular expression changes the resolution order. The iteration returns the first match based on object key order, while the regex returns the first match found linearly within the string. For heuristic mapping (like genre detection), this is acceptable or better, but could break strict ordering requirements in other contexts.
**Action:** When migrating iterative object searches to regex, verify if the application relies on the strict priority order of the object keys or if position-in-string resolution is acceptable.
