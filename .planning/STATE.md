## Accumulated Context

### Decisions
-   **Roadmap Depth**: Standard (4 phases identified, within typical 5-8 range)
-   **Phase Structure**: Derived from requirements and research summary, creating 4 distinct phases: Project Foundation, Core Prompting & Generation, Prompt Templating & Management, and Advanced Generation & Mutation.
-   **Requirement Mapping**: All 33 v1 requirements mapped to exactly one phase. FR4 requirements initially marked as "Future Phases" are now considered v1 and incorporated into Phase 3 and 4 based on research.

### ToDos
-   Complete traceability update in REQUIREMENTS.md.
-   Present structured draft for user approval.

### Blockers
-   None.
